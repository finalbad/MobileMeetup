<h2>Suggestion:</h2>

<p>OpenGL has a steep learning curve. Figuring out why something isn't working can be difficult if you don't already know all the parts of its workflow. I've used GLKit to allow me to defer learning certain parts of it while learning others. Since it's completely modular, you can transition parts of your code out of GLKit and into regular OpenGL ES 2.0 as it becomes necessary to do so.</p>
