<h3>Other Notes:</h3>

<p>I created the object in Blender. The texture coordinates are assigned in Blender as well.
It was then exported to a Wavefront .obj file, and converted from .obj to a C header file using a perl script.
The perl script can be found here: https://github.com/HBehrens/obj2opengl</p>
